React can be used as the v in MVC
ES2015
writing React components

component-based architecture

component in React is like a JS function
- it generates output every time it is invoked

Virtual DOM
 - in-mem representation of DOM generated by React components
  before any changes are made to the page

  Virtual DOM -> (actual) HTML
  diffing - allows React to minimize changes to the DOM as a result of
        user actions, increasing browser performance

        i.e. only the HTML elements updated are replaced


=== writing our first component ===
babel - ES2015 and JSX


- inherit from React.Component
- must have a render() function
- render() returns markup using JSX
- tell app where to put it in the webpage


1b =====================

JSX can be mixed with JS
to insert JS code into JSX, {}
